    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether a specific assumption or claim \n",
    "about a population parameter is supported by the evidence provided by a sample.\n",
    "It is an important tool in statistical analysis because it allows researchers to make \n",
    "informed decisions based on empirical data, rather than relying solely on intuition or speculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, a researcher will begin by stating a null hypothesis, \n",
    "which is the assumption that there is no significant difference between the population parameter\n",
    "and the sample statistic. The researcher will then collect data and use statistical methods to \n",
    "calculate the probability of obtaining the observed sample result under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "If this probability is very low, typically less than 5% (known as the significance level), \n",
    "the researcher will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative hypothesis,\n",
    "which states that there is a significant difference between the population parameter and the sample\n",
    "statistic, is more likely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypothesis testing in statistics lies in its ability to \n",
    "provide a framework for making logical and informed decisions based on empirical evidence. \n",
    "By using hypothesis testing, researchers can determine whether a specific claim or assumption about\n",
    "a population is supported by the available data, which can have important implications in fields such \n",
    "as medicine, engineering, and social sciences. Hypothesis testing is also an important tool for \n",
    "researchers who wish to test the effectiveness of new interventions, treatments, or policies.\n",

    "Overall, hypothesis testing plays a critical role in statistical\n",
